Kubernetes extension for VSTS (Early Alpha)
===

Enable Kubernetes extension for VSTS. Kubernetes endpoint for kubectl config and kubectl apply build task.
Mainly aim for using Linux Hosted Agent(preview).

# 1. Build the extension

I tested via windows environment.
```
npm test               // Compile Typescript and Test these
npm run deploy         // Deploy kubectl and node_modules into task directory
npm run build          // Build *.vsix file
``` 

If you want to debug these. NOTE: I'm using GitBash for this developmnet.
You can see the debug output. 
```
 export TASK_TEST_TRACE=1
```

# 2. Upload to the market place

Go to the Market place [Market Place Manage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
Then upload and share with your VSTS account.

# 3 Current road map

Now I just start this project. Just initial commit. 
However, you can see the image of the endpoint and build task. 

1. Flexbile Command Excecution except for `kubectl apply` 
2. Enable to select the version of kubectl and automatically installed.

# 4 How to use this

## 4.1. Create an endopint 

### Choose Kubernetes endpoint

Choose Kubernetes endpoint.

### Set your endpoint 

Kubernetes Connection pops up. Then fill the box.

* Connection name: Endpoint name (Anything is OK)
* Server URL : K8s Cluster URL for memo (Not used for the task until now)
* kubeconfig : Copy & paste your config file 

You can get config file from your k8s master node `.kube/config`. 
See [Microsoft Azure Container Service Engine - Kubernetes Walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough)
Then copy the file content and paste on kubeconfig column.

## 4.2. Store and link kubectl command link with VSTS private repository

Link your repo which has kubecntl command. 

Please `chmod +x kubectl` before adding kubectl to your repo.


## 4.2. Setup your k8s task

Then you can use the endpoint, specify the kubectl command and YAML file 
for deployment. Internally, it calls `kubectl apply` command. 

If you want to change the YAML file dynamically, you can use [Replace tokens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qetza.replacetokens) on the VSTS Marketplace.
